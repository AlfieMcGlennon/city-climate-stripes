# 🌍 City Climate Bars & Stripes — Replicated

Interactive city climate bars/stripes with **annual and seasonal** temperature anomaly views.  
Built as a side project to demonstrate data manipulation and the use of **artificial intelligence** for creating accessible, engaging visualizations and dashboards.

---

## ⚙️ Overview
This project replicates the famous *“Climate Stripes”* concept by [Ed Hawkins (University of Reading)](https://showyourstripes.info), extending it to individual cities with options to:
- Switch between **annual and seasonal (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON)** temperature anomalies  
- Toggle between **bars** and **stripes** visual modes  
- Adjust **baseline periods** (1850–1900 or 1961–2010)  
- Experiment with **colour scaling** modes (fixed or auto)  
- Quickly browse cities with **← / → arrow keys**  
- Download the current view as a **PNG image**

## 🧠 About the Project
This visualization was built as a personal and educational experiment in data visualization and user interface design, leveraging AI-assisted development to refine the user experience.

> **Note:**  
> The Berkeley Earth city alignment is relatively heavily filled, and the latitude/longitude mapping of cities is not guaranteed to be perfectly accurate.  
> This project should be treated as a **fun and exploratory visualisation**, not a scientific dataset.  
> For robust scientific analysis and data integrity, please refer to the [official Climate Stripes project](https://showyourstripes.info).

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Select a country** and **city**, or use the **search box**.  
2. Choose a **season** (Annual, DJF, MAM, JJA, SON).  
3. Switch between **bars** (with axis) and **stripes** (simplified).  
4. Change **baseline** to see different reference periods.  
5. Adjust **colour scale** (Fixed, Auto Symmetric, or Auto Range).  
6. Use **← / →** to browse through cities quickly.  
7. Click **Download PNG** to save your current view.
